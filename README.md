# Sierpinksi-Triangle-

Sierpinksi Triangle is a self structured triangle that is made up of a series of points. The points are calculated by finding the midpoints of the line segments of the largest triangle. Then, by connecting these midpoints smaller triangles are created. This pattern is then repeated for the smaller triangles.
